A new folder `{{name}}` has been created for your project.

Your project is ready to deploy by entering the folder and running the lambdasync command:
```
cd {{name}}
lambdasync
```

The `index.js` is the entry point of your application.

The `lambdasync.json` file contains lambdasync metadata. You should never have to touch this file manually.
